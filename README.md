## The Problem
The Palmoria Group is a fictitious manufacturing company based in Nigeria and it is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. 
The media recently published in the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealing other issues like gender pay gap amongst other possible issues. 
The CHRO, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe has been assigned the task to identify key areas within the business that could spring up issues and address them immediately.
Mr. Shofoluwe decided to recruit me as a HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. “Now, the future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” he said.

## Questions
In order to gather information and insights on the issue being faced by the Palmoria Group, I was asked to provide answers to the following questions
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management.
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
- Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. Also   visualize this by regions.

5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since I was already working on the employee data, I could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed another data to me which contains rules for making bonus payments and asked me to;
i. Calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual employees.
ii. Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus).
iii. Calculate the total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.
