# Palmoria-Group-Employees-Analysis

## Introduction
The Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria and it is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. 
The media recently published in the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealing other issues like gender pay gap amongst other possible issues.
